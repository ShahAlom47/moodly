**MOODLY** is a Real-time Emotion and Face Detection App built using **Next.js** and **face-api.js**.

The app uses your camera to scan your face and detects **age**, **gender** (male/female), and **emotion** â€” then responds with a fun **sound**, **emoji rain**, and a **funny message** based on your detected emotion.
